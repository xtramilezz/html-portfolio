<h1>The Best Movies According to Buji</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>This is my favorite historical epic and especially the music in this movie is so inspiring.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It's one of the best classical American movies of all-time. It's admiring to me, how someone goes so quiet when things are at the worst possible but keeps going forward with hope only until the very end. </p>
<h3>Jurassic World 2015</h3>
<p>It's an awesome sci-fi, thriller movie about deadly dinosaur gets loose at the newest theme park Jurassic Island. </p>
